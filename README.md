# GenePrioritization
A Gene Prioritization Framework designed for the summary GWAS Studies.

Genome-Wide Association Studies(GWAS) for complex traits typically result in the many loci across the genome. Translating these GWAS findings into treatments may require an understanding of casual variants, target genes, and their biological mechanisms. 

Identifying the underlying target genes for GWAS loci has the following challenges :

a) Casual SNPs do not necessarily regulate the closest genes. b) Using only gene expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL)  or functional genomics approaches may explain the limited proportion of heritability. c) Locus-specific identification is challenging given the annotation quality. 


Here we propose a gene prioritization framework to overcome this challenges.
